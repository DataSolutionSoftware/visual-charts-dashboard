# Automated Reporting with an Integrated 

When delving into the realm of reporting, one platform that stands out prominently is Microsoft's Power BI. Renowned for its versatility, Power BI seamlessly connects to a myriad of data sources, ranging from familiar databases like MySQL and SQL Server to widely-used platforms such as Google Sheets, Excel, CSV, and Microsoft Data Lake, among others.

A compelling use case in the reporting domain involves the visualization of data extracted from CRM systems like Streak CRM or Project Management Systems like JIRA Asana etc. Virtually every major CRM offers the capability to set up webhooks, enabling you to update your database in real-time based on specific actions within the CRM, such as lead generation, conversions, and other pivotal events.

For a budget-friendly solution, consider employing Google Sheets as a data aggregator. To achieve this, establish API endpoints on the spreadsheet side, leveraging Google Apps Script. These endpoints can then be utilized when configuring webhooks, ensuring that your Google Sheet remains dynamically updated with the latest CRM data. Macros could be written to transform the fetched data in the Google sheet itself. Or periodic triggers could also be written for other data related maintenance stuffs.

If you choose Excel instead of Google sheets then the same can be achieved using Microsoftâ€™s Power Automate, that is a low code/no code solution widely used by industries for automating several tasks. These setups and configurations are relatively complicated when compared with Google Sheets. And it also requires a paid subscription to Office 365.

When it comes to reporting, two powerful tools come to the forefront: Microsoft's Power BI and Google's Data Studio. Your Google Sheet can be seamlessly integrated as a data source for both platforms. In Power BI, you can interactively visualize your data, although it's important to note that Power BI is not suitable for controlling the data-fetching process.

For a more customized approach, consider developing your own data service using technologies like Express, Python or any other technologies. Create REST APIs to establish a connection between your chosen technologies and databases such as PostgreSQL or MySQL. Power BI can then be employed to fetch and visualize data from these databases, providing a tailored solution to your reporting needs.

This integrated approach not only ensures the seamless flow of data from various sources to your reporting tools but also empowers you to adapt and customize the process based on your specific requirements. It's a dynamic strategy that combines the strengths of established tools with the flexibility of custom solutions.
